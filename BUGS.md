## Open Issues

### QUALITY-012 — `syscall.Exec` is Unix-only in `SWIRuntime.Exec` (Low)

**File:** `internal/runtime/swi.go:9,202`
**Found:** Phase 1.7 implementation

`SWIRuntime.Exec()` uses `syscall.Exec` which is not available on Windows.
Phase 1 targets Linux and macOS only, so this is not blocking, but Phase 4
(Windows support) will need a build-tag split (`exec_unix.go` / `exec_windows.go`)
or an alternative using `os/exec.Command` + `os.Exit` on Windows.

**Fix:** When Windows support is added in Phase 4, split `Exec()` into
platform-specific files with build tags.
